# TheNest

This is our submission to the Quandela iQuHack 2024 In-Person Challenge. 

In our project, we built a somewhat functional QuGAN to help train an algorithms to produce a target state when given an input state. We used Quandela's solution for quantum computation with linear optics called Perseval to build out our solution.
